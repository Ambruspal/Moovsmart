This project is an early test of my HTML5 - CSS3 - JS knowledge after about 1 month of web development studies. The upper-middle three card links's subpages consist some javaScript functionalities , such as communicating with JSON-server, registering users and properties, and also rendering content. To go back to the main page is only available by the URL or by jumping back ( <-- ).
